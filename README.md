this is a survey and feedback application using file memory.
i used N-tyre Achitectural design. 
This application allows a user to register, login and create a survey, view survey feedback and check if the survey have been approved or denied by the admin.
a admin can also login to view list of users in the application, approve or deny survey and check all survey but the admin doesnt have access to the feedback given on the survey.
Before anyone can give feedback to any survey it has to be approved by the admin.
any user can then come and give feedback on the survey rendering only his email before giving feedback.
